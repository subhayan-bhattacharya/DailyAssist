## Development Workflow
- Always activate the conda environment before running any commands: `source /usr/local/Caskroom/miniconda/base/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate dailyassist`
- Periodically run pre-commit autoupdate to update pre-commit and also run pre-commit on all the files whenever we make changes
